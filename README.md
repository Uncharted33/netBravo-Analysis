# netBravo-Analysis

This research analyses crowd-sourced open data provided by NetBravo from 2016 to 2021 in Europe to reveal how network features like speed, coverage, and channel occupancy improved. Also, this research compares different types of network connections (Wi-Fi and cellular) and different technology (Wi-Fi 2.4GHz/5GHz and cellular 2G/3G/4G) to find out similarities, differences and performance characteristics for each of them. Lastly, the data provides geospatial information that allows to make a country-wise analysis of network characteristics. 

- evolution.ipynb is used for a general analysis on the evolution of network performance from 2016-2021 across Europe.
- countries.ipynb is used for a country-wise analysis of network performance.

1. The network data can be downloaded from: https://netbravo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/OpenData/Index.
2. The file containing European borders necessary for the country-wise analysis can be found here: https://kodu.ut.ee/~kmoch/geopython2019/L2/crs-projections.html.
3. The results of the analysis can be found in the following paper: http://essay.utwente.nl/87343/.
